Blackmagic for the STM8S Discovery Board
========================================

The board is a ST-Link V1 Board, but with access to JTAG pins accessible
on CN5. This allows easy reprogramming and reuse of the JTAG header.
Programmatical it seems indistinguishable from a e.g. STM32VL
Discovery. So here avariant that uses CN5 for JTAG/SWD_TRACESWO and CN7 for
UART.

Force Bootloader entry is done with shorting CN7 Pin3/4 so PB6 read low while
pulled up momentary by PB6.

Reuse SWIM Pins for Uart (USART1)
RX: CN7 Pin2 ->SWIM_IN (PB7)/USART1_RX / SWIM_IN(PB9)
TX: CN7 Pin4 -> SWIM_RST_IN(PB6)/USART1_TX
